=============

A simple Node app that creates an API endpoint for the [National Park Service data of Historic Places](http://www.nps.gov/nr/research/)

Inspired by [this tweet by Zach Kelin](https://twitter.com/zachklein/status/565387078733955072)

Endpoint accessible at: http://rileypoole.herokuapp.com/api/locations.json
